# Overview
Hello Animal is an educational computer program targeted at primary/elementary school students to improve their English proficiency and vocabulary. The program is built with C# and WPF and uses Kinect as a speech recognizer and also as the main interaction media for children.

This project was done as part of Human & Computer Interaction course, as the students for this course are required to develop from an existing appication or develop a whole new application from scratch, using unconventional/niche platforms such as Virtual Reality or Kinect (via PC) to emphasize on the interaction between the human (user) and the computer.

# Application overview
This application is targeted towards primary/elementary school students to improve their English fluency and vocabulary. We see that conventional learning methods are getting a bit outdated and we see an opportunity for 'why not breaking the market using our app as the media?'

This app uses Kinect as the main input for the speech recognizer, and users will interact with the app by using their voice. All app interactions are speech-based, and because of that the Kinect is an integral part of the app. This application has 9 difficulty stages (levels), with the first three levels show the animals' names, the second three obscures some of the animals' names, and the last three completely obscures the animals' names.
The users will then have to say the animals' names as shown on the screen (or by guessing it, depending on the difficulty). After a few animal screens, the game ends, and shows how well you do in the game by showing you the score. Hooray!

# System Requirements (based on development computer)
* Windows system with at least .NET Framework 4.5 installed
* Xbox 360 Kinect

# Installation
We're still working for application deployment, but you can always build yourself by building the application from the solution. Stay tuned for updates!
